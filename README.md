# Securing-Digital-Identity-Data-using-Two-Layer-Encryption-LSB-Steganography

In this project, we have used ECC & Huffman-Encoding to encrpty the data. To hide the encrypted data in the text we have used LSB Steganography. Also, we have analyzed the PSNR value which shows a better result on using ECC with Huffman Encoding.
